# Snake

Programming Languages: HTML, JavaScript, CSS (in html)

This is my recreation of the classic game Snake. I learned a lot while creating this, primarily the interaction of JS files and exporting/importing specific functions, variables, and constants as needed. The game will run as many times as pleased, but instead of a reset, it essentially just reloads the page after the game is over.
